# staff-app
Staff data management application. Will integrate with inventory-app that manages inventory / items that can be assigned to a staff.

## Getting started
To make things easier, I provided an sql file at the root `DatabaseTugas24.sql` to be run immediately so that you can directly create the database needed to run this program.

## Testing
I also provide export endpoints collections from Postman which you can import directly into your Postman.
In a file with the name `StaffApp.postman_collection.json`.
